--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project scope was to encompass downtown highpoint. We quickly relized the scope of the project was too large and decided to
reduce it to one intersection.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current state of this project has no UI, but does feture text output proving a working intersection.
